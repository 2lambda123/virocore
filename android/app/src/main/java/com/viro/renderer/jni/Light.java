/**
 * Light is a light source that illuminates Nodes in the {@link Scene}. Lights can be added to Nodes
 * so they are part of the overall scene graph. The area each Light illuminates depends on its type,
 * which is determined by the subclass of Light used. {@link Spotlight}, for example, illuminates a
 * cone-shaped area; AmbientLight, on the other hand, illuminates everything in the Scene with a
 * constant intensity.
 * <p>
 * The way in which a Light interacts with each surface of a {@link Geometry} to produce a color
 * depends on the materials used by the Geometry, along with the properties of the Light itself.
 * For more information see the Lighting and Materials guide.
 * <p>
 * Lights are performance intensive so it is recommended to use as few as possible, and only to
 * light dynamic objects in the Scene. For static objects, it is better to use pre-generated
 * lighting (e.g. baking the lighting into textures).
