/**
 * The Camera defines the point of view of the user in the {@link Scene}. You can display the
 * Scene from the point of view of any {@link Node}. To do this, create a {@link Camera} and attach
 * it to a Node via {@link Node#setCamera(Camera)}. Then make that Node the point of view for the
 * renderer by invoking {@link ViroView#setPointOfView(Node)}.
 * <p>
 * Camera is used to change the user's view of the scene. Note that when in AR or VR modes, the
 * point of view is automatically computed based on the device's rotation and position in the
 * world. This class is primarily for use with {@link ViroViewScene}.
 * <p>>
 * Because Camera is included in the scene graph, it can be moved, animated, and rotated
 * alongside other Nodes. You can also set the position and orientation of the Camera object itself.
 * <p>
 * The initial orientation of the camera is pointing in the negative Z direction: that is, into the
 * screen. If no point of view is set in the {@link Renderer}, the user will be positioned at the
 * origin looking in the negative Z direction.
