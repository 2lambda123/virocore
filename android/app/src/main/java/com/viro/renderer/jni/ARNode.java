/**
 * ARNode is a specialized {@link Node} that corresponds to a detected {@link ARAnchor}. ARNodes are
 * automatically created by Viro and added to the {@link Scene} as they are detected, and by default
 * hold no content and have no children. Each ARNode is continually updated to stay in sync with its
 * corresponding ARAnchor: if the anchor's position, orientation, or other detected properties
 * change, the ARNode will be changed as well.
 * <p>
 * ARNode is the mechanism through which you can attach virtual content to real-world objects. For
 * example, if an {@link ARPlaneAnchor} is detected, you can add a 3D model to that plane by loading
 * the {@link Object3D} and making it a child of the ARNode.
