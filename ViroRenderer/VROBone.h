/*
 VROBones are the control points for skeletal animation. They are animatable: 
 to drive a skeletal animation, invoke setTranform() for the bones that should 
 be animated within an animation block. This will animate the bones, which in
 turn animates the VROSkeleton, which in turn (by way of VROSkinner objects) 
 animates any attached VROGeometry objects.

     In other words, this transform moves from the bind position to the animated
     position, and moves *up* one coordinate space in the skeleton. 
     
     Therefore, by concatenating all bone transforms together hierarchically, we can
     unwind local bone transforms into a full skeletal transform, back in the coordinate 
     space of the skeleton (and geometry).
     
     Animatable: changing this value drives the skeletal animation.
