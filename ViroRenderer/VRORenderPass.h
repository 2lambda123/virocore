 Render passes represent a rendering of the scene to produce one or more render targets.
 Render passes take the full 3D scene as input, along with any previously created render
 targets. They can either render the 3D scene to a target, or implement post-processing by
 taking the input targets and creating new output targets.
 
 Render passes are chained together via the VROChoreographer.
 
 Render passes can also be configured to write directly to the display, in which case they
 may return no targets.
