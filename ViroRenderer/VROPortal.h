/*
 Portals are nodes that partition subgraphs of the overall scene
 graph. They are usedto simulate "teleportation" between two
 different scenes, and can also be used for more efficient visibility
 determination.
 
 Scenes are rendered one portal at a time. That is, we render a portal
 and its subgraph *up to* the next portals we find in the graph, then
 we render those sub-portals and their graphs, and so on.
