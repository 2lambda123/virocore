 VROSkinner is the base class for skeletal animation; it associates an animation
 skeleton with the geometry that will be deformed.
 
 A single VROSkeleton can be used by multiple VROGeometries; each geometry using
 the VROSkeleton will have its own VROSkinner that maps the geometry to the 
 skeleton.

     The transforms from model space (the coordinate space of _geometry) to the

     this tranforms a vertex in _geometry to its position relative to the given
     bone.
     
     These transforms serve two purposes:
     
     1. They place the geometry into the bind pose, the pose at which the geometry
     aligns with the skeleton, and from which its vertices can therefore be animated
     alongside the skeleton's bones.
     
     2. They transform from model space into the coordinate system of a given bone.
     This way we can animate vertices hierarchically: e.g. a finger vertex can animate
     around the finger bone, then the elbow, then the shoulder, etc. See VROBone.h
     and getWorldTransform() for more details.
     
     Finally, note that the transform at _bindTransforms[i] is for the bone in
     _skeleton.bones[i].
