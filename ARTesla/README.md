# ViroCore Tesla Demo  (AR)

This activity demonstrates how developers can easily add and detect a Viro Image Tracker object that represents a Tesla Image logo to be found in the AR environment. Here we use a "Model X Manual" logo. When the logo is found, a 3D Tesla Model is then placed at that location. Users can then click on the car to decide additional color options, as if you were painting your own car.
