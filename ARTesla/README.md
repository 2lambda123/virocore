# ViroCore Tesla Demo  (AR)

This activity demonstrates how developers can easily add and detect a Viro Image Tracker object that represents a Tesla Image logo to be found in the AR environment. When the logo is found, a 3D Tesla Model is then placed at that location, with additional interactivity options like a color picker (where users can choose the color of the car).

Note that for this Demo, we use the follow image below for tracking purposes. Please feel free to print out an A4 size version of the image to be used in this demo:
